This Single Page Application tracks workouts or exercises completed by the user. React is used for the front-end UI app, and a REST API using Node and Express is used for the back end. MongoDB is used to store data.

Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) workouts through the application. Attributes include exercise name, reps, weight, unit, and date.

The UI contains a home page, edit exercise page, and create exercise page. CSS is used for the page design.
